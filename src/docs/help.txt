 Timing issues:
 
   Q: The midi timing is very poor.
 	
   A: If you have any other applications open, try closing them.  If this
 	   doesn't work, perhaps you're drunk.  If drunk, fall down.  end if.
 
 
 Display issues:
 
   Q: The screen is beige/gray and is displaying  "This unit is in accordance
      with FCC standards for radio-interference emitting devices".
   
   A: You are looking at the back of the monitor.  For best results, look at
      the front, or "screen" of your monitor.
   
   
   Q: The screen is black and zTracker is not responding to any key/mouse
      commands.
   
   A: Your computer is not turned on.  Press the "power" switch on the front 
      of the housing and follow the resulting prompts.  You may also want to 
      gently pat the front of your pants using two outstretched fingers, to 
      ensure that you haven't wet yourself.
   
   
   Q: The screen is displaying a small cyan and red airplane on what appears 
      to be an airfield surrounded by buildings.  Occasionally, a small red 
      and cyan airplane flies by and shoots at the cyan and red airplane 
      and/or surrounding buildings.
   
   A: You are playing the DOS classic "Sopwith".   Depressing the "X" key 
      will cause your plane to accelerate, and you can control the direction 
      of your plane by pressing the "," and "/" keys.  The "." key will cause 
      your plane to invert - up is down, and down is up - watch out!


|L|%==|H|The Merits of zTracker|L|==%|U|


  	Congratulations on your decision to use zTracker, the champagne of midi
 sequencers.  Simply by choosing to employ zTracker as your personal midi 
 geisha, you've now moved yourself one notch further from "idiot" and 
 closer to "ultra-smartass".  (Refer to fig 1.1)  However, the fact that 
 you're reading the help file kicks you back one notch towards "idiot".  A 
 pointless exercise or a profound metaphor for our existence?  Only 
 continued use will tell - but if the rash persists, discontinue use 
 immediately.  Otherwise:
 
 	You, like the zTracker development team, [see fig 1.2] feel that 
 trackers are simply the best way to exert precise, megalomaniacal control 
 over sound.  But you're addicted to the high-fidelity, knob twiddling, 
 credit-card-maxed-out world of professional MIDI equipment.  Is there 
 some common ground where these two worlds meet, an interdimensional 
 portal sort of like the moongates first seen in Ultima IV? [see fig 1.3]
 
 
 	The answer is yes.  The answer is also zTracker.  
 	
 	To sum up: yes, zTracker.
 
 
 	In the past, those who exhibited proficiency with 
 light-and-switch-adorned gadgetry coupled with the need for complete 
 control of as many elements as possible were limited to careers in the 
 already saturated mad science and evil genius fields.
 
 
 	Until zTracker.
 
 
 	In these volatile times of sugarfree sugar and piano-playing robots, 
 many people are changing careers as many as twelve times during their 
 lifetime. An exciting career in the lucrative and burgeoning field of 
 musicianship awaits you!  Are you ready to meet the challenge?  Then join 
 in the cry:
 
 	zTracker: it is a midi tracker for writing music!
