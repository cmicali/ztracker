Building ztracker
-----------------
Written by Daniel Kahlin <tlr@users.sourceforge.net>

Required software:
- Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 6.0
- SDL 1.2.0 or later installed in your MSVC include and library path.
  (can be found at http://www.libsdl.org/)
- zlib 1.1.3 or later installed in your MSVC include and library path (lib\dll32).
  (can be found at http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/ or at http://www.zlib.org/)
- libpng 1.0.12 or later installed in your MSVC include and library path
  (can be found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/libpng/)

Additionally, if you want to build releases, these must be in your path:
- InfoZip (http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/)
- UPX - the Ultimate Packer for eXecutables (http://upx.sourceforge.net/)

If you want to make modifications to the graphics, you need:
- itf.exe for editing the font file.  (itf v1.61 can be found under
  required devel packages) 
- Adobe Photoshop or similar for editing the graphics in general.

Building Source Releases
------------------------
ztracker's source code is cvs based.  A release is built from the contents of the cvs archive at a point of time.  A release tag is set, the whole cvs tree exported and then
finally compressed into a .zip file.

Building Binary Releases
------------------------
Binary releases are built from the corresponding source release.

1. From the zt.dsw workspace build zt.exe as release.
2. Change the active project to ztconf.exe and build that as release.
3. Change the active project to ztskin.exe and build that as release aswell.
4. From a MS-DOS prompt, cd to the source directory and run buildrelease.bat.
   (You may want to edit the archive name)
5. Done!
